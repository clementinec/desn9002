# Recapping on Semester of Sustainable Leadership

## Sustainability
- Triple Bottom Line
  - People, Planet and Profit
- Systems Thinking
  - Inter-connected Everything
- 

## **1. Introduction and Key Principles**  
**Goal**: When/why would you consider a start-up investable.

- **Key Investment Criteria (Slide/Handout)**:
  1. **Value Proposition**: Is the problem being solved significant, and is the solution compelling?
  2. **Market Opportunity**: Is there a realistic and substantial target market?
  3. **Scalability**: Can the startup grow sustainably and profitably?
  4. **Team Credibility**: Does the team inspire confidence in their ability to execute?
  5. **Risk vs. Reward**: Are the risks manageable, and do the potential returns justify the investment?

---

## **2. Review and Group Analysis**  
**Goal**: Look at the two randomly-generated start-up profiles and determine which is a better bang of your bucks.

- **Activity**:
  - You would see a copy of the briefs on both companies in terms of:
    - A brief summary of one or two peer startups (pre-distributed or summarized by the instructor).
    - A scoring sheet based on the investment criteria.
  - Group with your team member and discuss and evaluate their assigned startup(s) based on the criteria, deciding:
    - Whether they would invest and how much of their $10,000 they would allocate.
    - A brief justification for their investment decision (2-3 points).

---

## **3. Investor Stances**  
**Goal**: Groups share their investment decisions and reasoning.

- **Activity**:
  - Each group presents their investment decision for 1-2 minutes:
    - How much virtual money they would invest.
    - Why they believe the startup is a good or risky investment, tied to the criteria.
  - The presenting group (or instructor) can respond briefly to questions, simulating an investor Q&A.

---

## **4. Wrap-Up and Reflection**  
**Goal**: Reflect on the process and lessons learned.

- **Discussion Prompts**:
  - *What did you learn about what the rest of the class believes makes a startup investable?*  
  - *How would you use this perspective to refine your own startup project?*

## Onward to Recapping Leadership

1.There are many leadership theories/approaches we can use to help us understand leadership in many contexts
  - Trait, style and behaviour, situational, process, transformational, transactional, autocratic, laissez-faire and democratic
2. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are important principles and processes for leaders, that can influence how leaders approach or go about collaboration and teamwork:
  - Ensuring everyone is included and their voice is represented
  - Noticing when discrimination and microaggressions might be affecting peoplesâ€™ participation and reaching their full potential
  - Microintervention strategies for inclusivity in group work
  - Honoring intellectual as much as social diversity, to enhance potential for innovation rather than trying to manage, control or exclude differences

4. The need to balance showing both strength/competency and warmth as a leader, and the various ways that this can translate into more effective ways of leading people
5. The need for leaders to balance both operational needs (short-term) and strategic vision (long-term), depending on their personal/professional goals for themselves and their organizations
6. Being a loyal critic of technology and its affordances and challenges in leadership contexts, and reflection upon how technological advancement is not only an end in itself, but a means by which we can enact different leadership practices
