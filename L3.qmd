# DEI Principles in AI Ethics: Navigating the Challenges of Bias

## 2: Introduction
- What is DEI?
  - Diversity: Variety in human differences
  - Equity: Fair treatment and access
  - Inclusion: Environment where all can thrive
- AI Ethics: Ensuring AI systems are fair and unbiased
- Today's Focus: How DEI principles apply to AI development and deployment
- Why are we having this session: **DEI are being compressed into datasets, which then gets used to derive ‘insights’ for leaders to act upon.** 

## 2.1: Introduction (Continued)

- Directly impacts an organization's long-term viability and social responsibility. 
- Sustainable leaders must ensure that AI systems to be: 
  - fair, 
  - unbiased, and 
  - beneficial to all stakeholders. 
- Ignoring DEI in AI can lead to reputational damage, legal risks, and erosion of trust, undermining sustainability efforts. 
- From a triple-bottom line perspective, this relates to:
  - people (ensuring AI benefits all segments of society), 
  - planet (using AI ethically to address environmental challenges), and 
  - profit (developing trustworthy AI for long-term business sustainability). 
- Key competency for leaders aiming to build resilient, ethical, and sustainable organizations in our increasingly AI-driven world.


## 3: The Problem of Built-in Biases

- Sources of AI Bias:
  1. Data Collection
  2. Algorithm Design
  3. Interpretation of Results
- _An AI system once classified a turtle as a rifle. Let's explore why!_

## 3.1 Turtle as Rifle, a built-in bias example

## 4: Interactive - Spot the Bias
- Instructions: Identify potential biases in these scenarios
  1. A speech recognition system struggling with accents
  2. An image dataset with 80% male CEOs
  3. A predictive policing algorithm focusing on certain neighborhoods
- Discussion: What biases did you spot? How might they impact real-world applications?

## 5: Case Study 1 - Twitter's Image Cropping Algorithm
- The Issue: Algorithm favored white faces over black faces
- Root Cause: Focus on high [contrast areas and facial features](https://x.com/MarkEMarkAU/status/1307616892551487488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1307616892551487488%7Ctwgr%5E6b3568c1d65770a8d4fd537e0e5b92ac6434e6d4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2020%2Fsep%2F21%2Ftwitter-apologises-for-racist-image-cropping-algorithm)
- Impact: Reinforced racial biases in social media representation
- Twitter's Response:
  - Made algorithm choices more transparent
  - Eventually removed automatic cropping

## 6: Case Study 2 - Amazon's AI Recruiting Tool
- The Problem: AI tool discriminated against women
- Key Issues:
  - Trained on 10 years of resumes, mostly from men
  - Penalized resumes including "women's"
  - Downgraded graduates of women's colleges
- Amazon's Action: Discontinued the tool
- Teaser: "Imagine applying for your dream job, but the AI says no. Ever heard of the 'this is an examplary candidate' trick?"

## 7: Leadership in DEI and AI Ethics
- Leaders' Roles:
  - Champion diversity in AI teams
  - Mandate thorough bias testing
  - Foster a culture of ethical AI development
- Why It Matters:
  - Business: Broader market appeal, avoid PR disasters
  - Ethical: Fair opportunities for all
  - Social: Build trust in AI technologies
- Reflection: "As a future leader, how will you promote DEI in tech?"

## 8: Scenarios  - Possible

Here’re some very straight forward examples of AI-driven solutions that you could develop without having good DEI awareness:

  - "The Resume Screener": AI favors certain universities
  - "The Loan Approver": Lower approval rates for specific postcodes
  - "The Employee Performance Predictor": Bias against flexible workers
  - Discussion: Identify DEI breaches and propose solutions

## 9. Scenarios - Real
Now let’s look at some real debacle of DEI failures by big corporates and highly-paid execs:

- Google Image Recognition Controversy (2015) : Tags
- Amazon’s AI Hiring Tool Bias (2018): Data
- Microsoft’s _Tay_ Chatbot Incident (2019): Guardrails/24h
- Uber’s Facial Recognition System Failure (2021): Facial Rec Color

## 10: Critical Thinking - The Complexities of "Fair AI"

Title: "Fair for Whom? Navigating the Complexities of DEI in AI"

- The Dilemma of Fairness:
  - What does "fair" mean in different contexts?
  - Can optimizing for one group inadvertently disadvantage others?

- Potential Trade-offs:
  - Accuracy vs. Inclusivity
  - Generalizability vs. Specificity
  - Speed of development vs. Thorough bias checking

- Discussion Angles:
  - "Is 'fair AI' truly fair for everyone? Who might be left out?"
  - "How do we balance addressing historical inequities without creating new ones?"
  - "What are the risks of over-correcting in AI design?"

## 10.1: Critical Thinking - The Complexities of “Fair AI” (Continued)
- Case Example: 
  - An AI healthcare diagnostic tool is adjusted to be more accurate for underrepresented groups
  - Result: Slight decrease in accuracy for the majority group
  - Question: "Is this ethical? How do we decide?"

- Activity: "Ethical AI Design Spectrum" (if we have enough time)
  - Position yourselves on a spectrum in the room
  - One end: "Maximum DEI considerations in AI, even if it slows development"
  - Other end: "Rapid AI development with basic fairness checks"
  - Discuss reasons for their positions

## 11: Balancing Act - Doing Enough, But Not Too Much

- Key Considerations:
  1. Regulatory Compliance: Meeting legal requirements
  2. Ethical Imperatives: Going beyond the law to ensure fairness
  3. Practical Constraints: Time, resources, and technological limitations

- Finding the Balance:
  - Continuous testing and iteration
  - Diverse team input in all stages of development
  - Regular ethical audits and transparency reports

- Discussion Question: 
  "How can we determine if we've done 'enough' to ensure fairness in AI systems?"

- Thought Experiment: "The AI Fairness Meter"
  - If you could design a tool to measure AI fairness, what metrics would you include?
  - How would you weigh different aspects of fairness against each other?

## 12: Conclusion and Next Steps
- Key Takeaways:
  - AI bias is often subtle but impactful
  - Proactive DEI integration is crucial in AI development
  - Ongoing vigilance and testing are necessary
- Your Action Item: "One thing I'll do to promote DEI in tech..."
