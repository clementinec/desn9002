## 3: The Tale of Two Projects
- Project A: Stuck in perfection loop
  - Endless revisions, missed deadlines
  - Never launched
- Project B: MVP approach
  - Quick initial release, iterative improvements
  - Successful market presence
Lesson: Sometimes, done is better than perfect

## 3.1.1: The Tale of Two Mail Services: Google's Gmail (Project B: MVP Approach)
- Launched in 2004 as invite-only beta

  - Longer development cycles
  - Difficulty in quickly responding to user needs
  - Struggled to differentiate from competitors
- Outcome:
  - Gradually lost market share to Gmail
  - Played catch-up in terms of features and user experience
