    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Pricing Carbon**: Puts a price on each tonne of greenhouse gas emitted\n",
    "2. **Revenue Generation**: Raises revenue for environmental initiatives, clean energy projects, or public.\n",

    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- **Canada**: A federal carbon pricing plan: adapt to the federal system or develop province-own upon.\n",
    "- **European Union**: Not a tax, EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) operates by capping emissions and allowing trading of emission allowances."

    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Cap-and-Trade**: Often part of a cap-and-trade system, where a limit is placed on emissions, and companies can buy or sell allowances.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: Allows companies with higher emissions to purchase credits from those with lower emissions.\n",

    "1. **Initial Allocation**: How allowances are initially distributed can be historical or auctioned off.\n",

    "3. **Implementation**: Differences in regional and national policies can lead to complexities in implementation.\n",

    "1. **Border Carbon Adjustments**: Taxes on the carbon content of imports to prevent businesses from moving to places with less stringent emissions regulations.\n",
    "2. **Increasing Prices**: Thereâ€™s a global push to increase the price of carbon to make these mechanisms more effective.\n"
