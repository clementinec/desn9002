# Business First



## Businesss Case 101
Building a Business Case involves estimating financial metrics that ensure sustainability and growth.

- Market Size Estimation (TAM-SAM-SOM)
- Cost Structure & Pricing
- Revenue Forecasting
- Return on Investment (ROI)

_Why are these important?_
Without a strong financial case, even the best ideas can struggle to survive. These metrics help determine if the startup is a viable business.

_Question for Students:_
Why do you think investors care so much about these numbers?

##  Introducing Financial Sustainability

**Financial Sustainability** 

- The ability of a startup to operate profitably over the long term without compromising core values.

**Key Factors**:

- **Efficient Cash Flow Management**
- **Sustainable Revenue Sources** (e.g., subscriptions, partnerships)
- **Resilient Cost Structure** that adapts to external pressures (e.g., economic downturns)

*Example*: GreenPack needs to monitor both profit margins and environmental impact to maintain sustainable growth.


## 1: Key Concepts for Financial Planning



**Building a Business Case** involves estimating financial metrics that ensure sustainability and growth.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Market Size Estimation** (TAM-SAM-SOM)
- **Cost Structure & Pricing**
- **Revenue Forecasting**
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**

*Why are these important?*  
Without a strong financial case, even the best ideas can struggle to survive. These metrics help determine if the startup is a viable business.

**Question for Students**:  
*Why do you think investors care so much about these numbers?*

## 2: Market Size Estimation
**Market Size Estimation** helps define the potential for a startup's product.

1. **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**  
   *Total potential revenue if every potential customer bought the product.*

2. **SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**  
   *Subset of TAM within the startup’s reach based on product reach and location.*

3. **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**  
   *Realistic portion of SAM that the startup aims to capture.*

**Example**:  
EcoSip TAM: $200M → SAM: $60M → SOM: $3M (5% of SAM)

*Practical Tip*: To get a good SOM, research similar products and look at how much market share they captured in their first few years.

**Class Activity Idea**:  
*Estimate SOM for a common product (e.g., reusable water bottle) in your local area. Think about factors that might reduce the number from TAM to SOM.*



## 3: Cost Structure & Pricing


**Cost Structure** - Defines all expenses involved in producing, distributing, and selling the product.

- **Fixed Costs**: Costs that don’t change (e.g., rent, salaries).
- **Variable Costs**: Costs that vary with production levels (e.g., materials, shipping).

**Pricing Strategies**:
- **Cost-Plus Pricing**: *Add a markup to production costs.* Common but might ignore competitor pricing.
- **Value-Based Pricing**: *Price based on perceived customer value.* This often allows for higher prices, especially if your product has unique benefits.

**Example**:  
EcoSip uses value-based pricing, charging a premium for eco-friendly materials and sustainability.

**Class Discussion Prompt**:  
*How do you think eco-friendly products should be priced compared to regular ones? Is it fair to charge more? Why or why not?*



## 4: Revenue Forecasting



**Revenue Forecasting** - Project the expected revenue based on market share, pricing, and sales strategy.

**Steps**:
1. **Estimate Sales Volume**: Based on SOM and realistic targets.
2. **Identify Revenue Streams**: Will you make money through direct sales, subscriptions, partnerships, etc.?
3. **Project Revenue Over Time**: Map out monthly, quarterly, or annual projections.

*Why is this useful?*  
A clear revenue forecast can prevent cash flow issues and guide operational planning.

**Example Activity**:  
*Take your SOM and estimate a simple revenue projection for the first year. What would be a reasonable growth rate each month?*

**Question for Students**:  
*Can you think of a company with an innovative revenue stream? How might EcoSip use something similar?*



## 5: Return on Investment (ROI) & Break-Even Analysis



**ROI (Return on Investment)** - Measures profitability by comparing net profit to initial investment.

- **Formula**: *(Net Profit / Initial Investment) x 100%*
- **Purpose**: Shows investors how quickly they might see returns.

**Break-Even Analysis** - Point at which revenue covers all costs.

- **Formula**: *Fixed Costs / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)*
- **Purpose**: Useful to know how long it will take to cover startup costs.

**Example**:  
EcoSip calculates its break-even point to understand how many units they need to sell to start making a profit.

**Interactive Prompt**:  
*Think about a product you buy regularly. At what price point would it be too expensive? What about too cheap?*


## 6: Cash Flow Management



**Cash Flow Management** - Tracking inflows and outflows to ensure positive cash flow.

1. **Positive Cash Flow**: Ensure inflows (sales) exceed outflows (expenses).
2. **Cash Flow Projection**: Plan expected inflows and outflows monthly, noting any potential cash shortages.
3. **Maintain Liquidity**: Reserve funds for unexpected expenses.

*Tip*: Cash flow issues are a leading cause of startup failure. Keeping projections realistic is essential.

**Example for Students**:  
Imagine EcoSip plans to launch a social media campaign but realizes it might run out of cash halfway through. A cash flow projection would help plan around this risk.

**Discussion**:  
*Can anyone think of a company that might struggle with cash flow? Why is managing cash important even if a company is profitable?*

## 7: Summary of Key Financial Planning Concepts

**Financial Planning Key Takeaways**:

- **Market Size Estimation** - Helps define the potential market and growth.
- **Cost Structure & Pricing** - Enables balancing of costs with revenue.
- **Revenue Forecasting** - Maps out short- and long-term growth.
- **ROI & Break-Even** - Key profitability metrics.
- **Cash Flow Management** - Essential for day-to-day operations.

*These concepts collectively support a strong, sustainable business case.*

## 8: Burn Rate & Runway, beyond revenue, cost and profit margins (YMMV, subscription only)


**Burn Rate** - Rate of cash expenditure per month. Helps determine operational efficiency and areas to reduce costs if needed.

**Runway** - The amount of time before cash reserves are depleted.  

**Formula**: *Runway (months) = Cash Reserves / Monthly Burn Rate*


## 9: Unit Economics & Sustainable Pricing


**Unit Economics** - Measure of profitability per product/service sold.

- **Revenue per Unit** minus **Cost per Unit**: Ensures each sale is profitable.
- **Sustainable Pricing**: Sets prices that reflect quality, cover costs, and align with the brand’s eco-friendly mission.

*Example*: GreenPack sets a premium price that covers higher material costs but appeals to clients who value sustainability.

**Question for Students**:  
*How could GreenPack communicate the added value of its sustainable materials to justify a higher price?*



## 10: CLV vs. CAC for Financial Sustainability


**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** - Total revenue from a customer over the CS relationship.

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** - Cost to acquire a new customer.

**For Financial Sustainability**:  
CLV should exceed CAC **significantly** to ensure profitability.

**Example for GreenPack**:  
If CAC is high due to marketing to eco-conscious businesses, GreenPack focuses on retaining customers through subscriptions, increasing CLV.

**Prompt for Students**:  
*Think of ways to increase CLV for GreenPack. How might subscriptions or referrals play a role?*


## 11: Revenue Diversification & Economic Resilience


**Revenue Diversification** - Having multiple income streams to reduce financial risk.

- **Subscription Model**: Predictable revenue from monthly/annual plans.
- **Bulk Orders & Partnerships**: Strategic alliances with larger companies.
- **Retail & Direct Sales**: Expanding to online direct-to-consumer sales.

**Economic Resilience**: Planning for changes in costs due to inflation, interest rates, and other external factors.

*Why it matters*: Sustainability-focused businesses often face higher material costs, making revenue diversification and cost control essential.
