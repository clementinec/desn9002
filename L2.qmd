## 5: From Pillars to Triple Bottom Line
- Title: "Evolving Concepts: Pillars to Triple Bottom Line"
- Three Pillars → Triple Bottom Line
  - Social → <mark>People</mark>
  - Environmental → <mark>Planet</mark>
  - Economic → <mark>Profit</mark>

## 6: The Triple Bottom Line
- Brief explanation of each component:
  - `People`: An organization's commitment to positively impacting society
  - `Planet`: An organization's effect on the environment
  - `Profit`: The financial return an orgnization generates for shareholders
- **Interconnectedness and balance**

# Going further into Principles

## 11: Key Sustainability Principles
- Precautionary Principle
- Intergenerational Equity
- **Systems Thinking**: Interconnected Everything
- Circular Economy: _Cradle-to-Cradle_
- Stakeholder Engagement

## 12: Systems Thinking

!["Thinking in Systems : A Primer" by Donella Meadows](https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/thinking-in-systems-cover.png){height="90%"}

## 12.1: Systems Thinking in Sustainability
- Definition: Considering the `interconnectedness` of various elements within a system
- Key aspects:
  1. **Holistic** view
  2. Feedback **loops**
  3. Emergent properties
  4. Non-linear relationships


## 13: Applying Sustainability Principles in Decision-Making
- Framework:
  1. Identify the issue
  2. Apply relevant principles
  3. Consider stakeholders
  4. Assess short and long-term impacts
  5. Evaluate alternatives
  6. Implement and monitor

## 14: Case Study - Wildlife Conservation and Ecosystem Balance

- Challenge: Balancing wildlife conservation with human needs in African savannas
- Principles applied: Systems Thinking, Precautionary Principle, Stakeholder Engagement

## 15: “Return of the Wolves”
   When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995, it triggered a trophic cascade that changed the rivers. The wolves kept elk populations in check, allowing trees to recover, which stabilized riverbanks and changed the course of rivers. This showcases the intricate connections in ecosystems.

# Additional Cases just for fun

## The Three Sisters
   - "The Three Sisters": Native American farming technique of planting corn, beans, and squash together. The corn provides a structure for the beans to climb, the beans fix nitrogen in the soil, and the squash spreads along the ground preventing weeds. It's a perfect example of _companion planting and systems thinking in agriculture_.

## The Duck Curve
   - "The Duck Curve": California's energy grid faces a unique challenge called the "duck curve." As solar power increases during the day, traditional power plants need to rapidly ramp up production when the sun sets. The graph of this phenomenon looks like a duck, hence the name. It's a great example of the complexities in transitioning to renewable energy.

## "The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894": 
  In the late 19th century, large cities faced a growing problem with horse manure from transportation. Some predicted London would be buried under 9 feet of manure by 1950. This crisis was averted not by better manure management, but by the invention of the automobile. It demonstrates how technological innovations can solve sustainability challenges in unexpected ways.
