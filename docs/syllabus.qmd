## Course Description:

"Leadership" often conjures up images of hierarchy, the top-down power that creates unnecessary tension between the haves and the have-nots. Such leadership can exacerbate social inequalities, alienation and environmental destruction. In a society that is increasingly connected, and evolving ever rapidly, this form of centralised concentrated leadership cannot answer to change fast enough.

So, what kind of leadership do we need to guarantee humans are best able to care for and support each other, and the environment? What are the other models of leadership we need? Where will this change come from? How will we adapt and evolve the current conception of leadership towards a more sustainable world?

It is clear that our generation has the duty to reinvent leadership and implement it in society overall. The University of Hong Kong’s Bachelor of Arts and Sciences (BASc) programmes are uniquely positioned to address such questions. Hong Kong and the world needs a new generation of leaders that understand empathy and interdependency, who are creative, resilient, visionary, and highly cooperative. Such qualities are better learned by experience than merely by theory. Not only is it about acquiring knowledge, but creating new knowledge about the forms of leadership we need for a sustainable world.
